# Face_Recognition
Hello World! This is my first Project using what all I have learned over the past year in quarantine. 

# Step - 1
Run the sorting_images.py to sort all your images based on the name. Feel Free to edit the code and change the way to read the file names

# Step - 2
Run the Encode_Face.py once to generate a CSV File consisting of all the encodings of all the faces present in all of the Images Present. Please run this only once (or) go ahead and change it to run it the way you want.
